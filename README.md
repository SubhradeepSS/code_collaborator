### Motivation
Due to the pandemic, the distance between peer programmers increased due to which productivity got decreased a lot for them. To overcome this situation, we got the idea of building a real time peer programming platform where they could solve programming problems, edit, chat and also share codes through whatsapp right from the platform itself.

### Existing solutions
Different online platforms like discord, google meet, teams etc. can be used for the problem.

### Drawbacks of existing solutions
* Many platforms dont allow real time code editing and support for running codes in multiple programming languages
* Sharing screen in the platforms requires much higher bandwidth internet, which might cause lags resulting in bad user experience.
* Most platforms dont have the support for direct sharing of entire code through sharing platforms.

### Features
* Secure Login/Signup system using auth0
* Support for light and dark theme
* Create password-based rooms for peers to collaborate
* Users can create/join multiple rooms
* Real time code editing, running with periodic auto save feature
* Support for multiple programming languages, font size and code editor theme, along with error and output to debug the code.
* Built in realtime chat along with timestamps, dedicated to a room
Code sharing through WhatsApp using Twilio

## Future Scope
* Add audio chat
* Collaborative drawing board like jamboard
* Sharing code through other platforms like Slack, Discord etc.
* Integrating better code formatting and styling in code editor
* Convert website to Desktop app
